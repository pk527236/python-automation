# === Example Usage ===

bucket_name = "demo-bucket-python-unique-12345"
region = "us-east-2"

# Step 1: Show current buckets
show_buckets(s3_resource)

# Step 2: Create bucket
# create_bucket(s3_client, bucket_name, region)

# Step 3: Upload file
# upload_backup(s3_client, bucket_name, "/home/user/python-automation/backup/backup_2025-07-13.tar.gz")

# Step 4: Delete bucket and all contents
# delete_bucket(s3_client, s3_resource, bucket_name)
